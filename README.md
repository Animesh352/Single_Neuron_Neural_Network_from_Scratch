# Logistic Regression on Diabetes Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing logistic regression using a single neuron neural network on the Diabetes dataset. The goal is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health features.

## Contents
- **Introduction**: Overview and references.
- **Importing Libraries**: Code snippet to import necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Dataset Insights**: Code for importing, summarizing, and exploring the dataset characteristics including handling null values, duplicates, and understanding data distribution.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Detailed steps including normalization techniques like Z-score normalization and Box-Cox transformation, aimed at preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Creation**: Detailed explanation and implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch including the mathematical foundations and coding aspects.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques and code snippets for evaluating the performance of the created model.
